## 📝 Overview

This repository contains a **Python-based software** designed to automate the processing, analysis, and visualization of **Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)** spectroscopy data.

Developed during my experience at the **Composite Materials and Adhesives Laboratory at UFRJ**, this tool was created to optimize the characterization workflow of metallic and non-metallic materials, reducing data processing time and ensuring standardization in spectral analysis.

> **Note:** Due to confidentiality agreements related to industrial research projects, the datasets provided in this repository are **dummy/simulated data** solely for demonstration purposes. No proprietary data from external partners is disclosed.

## 🎯 Key Features

* **Automated Data Import:** Batch processing of raw spectrum files (e.g., `.CSV`, `.SPA`, `.TXT`).
* **Signal Processing:**
    * Automatic Baseline Correction.
    * Noise reduction / Smoothing algorithms.
* **Peak Detection:** Algorithm to identify and label significant peaks in the spectrum automatically.
* **Visualization:** Interactive plotting for comparative analysis of multiple samples.
* **Report Generation:** Automatic export of processed data and graphs.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Scientific Computing:** SciPy (Signal processing)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
* **Interface (GUI):** [Tkinter / PyQt / Streamlit - Escolha o que usou]
